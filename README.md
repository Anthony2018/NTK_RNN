# NTK_RNN

1. Research roadmap fall 2021:
   1. Figure out the NTK Theory and basic application(week 7):
      1. Network structure
      2. How this network working (loss, optimizer, boundary situation) 
      3. Basic code for this section
   2. How to apply the NTK on the LSTM structure(week 8):
      1. Which gates/ structure (RNN/LSTM) can be replaced by the NTK
      2. Is there any basic coding for NTK-RNN
      3. Recurrent the basic NTK-RNN on some dataset (NTU-60)
   3. Analysis of the NTK-RNN(week 9):
      1. What are the  benefits we can get from the NTK
      2. What is the disadvantage/loss from the NTK
      3. Can we improve the networks to avoid the disadvantage? How to improve?
2. Research possible results for this quarter:
   1. Build the baseline model for NTK-RNN (push on the GitHub (private): https://github.com/Anthony2018/NTK_RNN)
   2. Finalize a report on the  this result:
      1. Theory section:  understanding and proof NTK_RNN (LSTM) 
      2. Method section: NTK,  NTK_RNN, NTK
      3. Experiment section: NTU60,  and other possible dataset
   3. Finalize a report on the this result (week 10):
      1. Theory section:  understanding and proof NTK_RNN (LSTM)
      2. Method section: NTK, NTK_RNN, NTK
      3. Experiment section: NTU60, and other possible dataset
